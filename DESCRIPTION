Description: Provides functions and a workflow to easily and powerfully calculating specificity, sensitivity and ROC curves of biomarkers combinations. Allows to rank and select multi-markers signatures as well as to find the best performing sub-signatures, now also from single-cell RNAseq datasets. The method used was first published as a Shiny app and described in Mazzara et al. (2017) <doi:10.1038/srep45477> and further described in Bombaci & Rossi (2019) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-9164-8_16>, and widely expanded as a package as presented in the preprint Ferrari et al. <doi:10.1101/2022.01.17.476603>.
